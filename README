Hello from Remote Diagnostics Tool (RDT)

Desktop Administrators and Helpdesk staff will benefit from using this tool. No Installation is required. Free fully functional Product!

This remote diagnostics tool (RDT) was designed and written to aid in the diagnostics and overall investigation of a remote PC whilst it is on a
corporate network, without interrupting the user in their daily work. 

The tool was originally designed as a replacement to a few different well-known script tools like the “SCCM Client tools” and “Dameware” as we were
not allowed to use them on the corporate network anymore. “They were too intrusive”.

The aim of interrogating information from the PC like: SCCM execution reports and Installed software lists was the main key but the tool seems to
have grown much larger than first anticipated and it now does many other helpful functions as they were requested by people over the years.

Please make sure you are allowed to use this tool on your domain and have read this help file and the disclaimer at the bottom of this file thoroughly
before continuing!

This tool was written in VB.Net which requires .NET 4.0 to be on the running Administrators PC (or server) where the tool is being run from. 
Windows 7/8/10/11 or Server 2012/2016/2019/2022/2025 has this by default. This tool supports Microsoft Windows OS only!

Any feedback good or bad welcome: Please email RemoteDiagnosticsTool@outlook.com. Improvements and refinements are always being made.

Please check the web for a copy of the latest version which may just have the fix or added information you requested already.
